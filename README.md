# Feast It - Bookmark test
### What I did...
For this challenge, I decided on what the state would be and built the form around that. I then created the onChange and onSubmit methods to edit the state and render the list of arrays. I was unable to finish the task so rushed a few aspects of the test...
### What went well...
* Creating the basic form
* Writing the initial onChange and onSubmit methods
* Using props to form the ListItems component
* Rendering a list of items that are entered in the form

### What I would do if I had more time...
* Edit list items on click
* Fix the removeItem method
* Put the styling in a separate Component
* Post the data to an external API and use the fetch() method to pull in data
